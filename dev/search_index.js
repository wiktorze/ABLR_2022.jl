Firstly, as we performed the logarithmic transformation on variables multiple times per .jl file, we had to manually clean the data such that values out of bounds in were omitted in Julia while the process for dropping such values in Stata is more opaque to the user. Secondly, Stata and Julia handles missing values differently and for us, we manually cleaned the data on our end to drop the missing data in Julia. Lastly, given these differences, the residuals and the number of observations computed in Stata and in Julia for regression analysis are likely to differ slightly because of this.
